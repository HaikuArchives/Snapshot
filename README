Snapshot

Ever wished you could go back to earlier versions of a file or folder?

Snapshot lets you take "snapshots" of a folder,
saving it as a zip file, with a timestamp, to a preset folder.

Snapshots are currently saved to 
/boot/home/Snapshots

If you prefer another location, you can replace
this folder with a symlink, or edit the source.
(MakeDefaultSettings())

I've been meaning to create this app for years, 
so I've rushed this release to finally "get it out there".
(no preferences GUI yet, perhaps in 2.0.. see To Do file)

Let me know what you think about it! 

Btw, Snapshot is a Tracker add-on, so you have 
to put it in /boot/home/config/add-ons/Tracker.

To use it, select a folder, or whatever, in Tracker, 
and then press Alt-Option-P, or select Snapshot
from Tracker's right-click menu.
